# AVL Tree

Here I have implemented an AVL Tree, a type of self-balancing binary search tree, in pure C++. I expose a `BinarySearchTree` class and a `TreeMap` class. These classes mimic the type of behaviour you would observe from the `std::set` in C++ or `TreeSet` in Java, and the `std::map` in C++ or `TreeMap` in Java, respectively.
